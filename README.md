# border_and_corner_detection_and_clusterization

As a task for artificial intelligence course we had to implement border and corner detection algorithms plus a clusterization algorithm to count how many corners there are. I had this weird idea to use previously implemented expectation maximization clustering algorithm that was somewhat suitable for this task while there were a couple dozen of corners in the picture. No need to say that it was slower than anything my peers came up with and it didn't really work for anything beyond that, BUT it turned out I could generate interesting images with it.

Here are a few of my favourite examples:

A random photo of a cat:

My girlfriend holding a kitten we were about to adopt:

The kitten a few weeks later:

Feel free to do anything with this and may the odds be in your favour.
